# Adventure-Works-Cycles
I developed a project to analyze the sales data of Adventure Works Cyclist, a fictional bicycle manufacturer, using Power BI and SQL.
The goal of this project was to gain insights into the company's sales trends and customer behavior, which can help the company to
make informed decisions about their product offerings, promotions, and marketing campaigns.
